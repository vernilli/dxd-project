I’m an end-to-end product designer who strongly believes user-centered design can create meaningful and impactful products.

Defined as a generalist, I’m comfortable collaborating and building products from scratch to release. With a strong tech background, I’m able to transit from research to front-end technologies.

I’m the type of designer who loves work hands-on, researching, designing, and coding and sees all the work comes alive.

But before a Designer, I’m a human being... we all ARE. Before users or clients, we are HUMANS. That mindset can make the best changes in the tech-based industry.

Also, I love history 🗿 (we can learn a lot with it) and eager to discover new things. Practicing sports is one of my favorite hobbies (Table tennis player in development 🏓) I’m also a coffee lover ☕

So, let’s grab a coffee and have a talk.
